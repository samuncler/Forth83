This disk contains F83.68K, a public domain implementation of FORTH-83 that
is ready to run. It also contains source files in squeezed format.  I have 
squeezed them using the public domain utility SQ and you can unsqueeze them 
with the USQ utility. Squeezed files have a Q in the file type.

The original Laxen-Perry distribution had these files squeezed with a program
that took hours (!) to run to unsqueeze. USQ will run in minutes and the 
squeezed files take up less space than the original distribution disk. Make B: 
(or C:) your default drive. Have plenty of room on your default drive and then 
type A:USQ20 A:filename.BQK to make filename.BLK on your default drive. 

Since I don't have a CP/M68K system to use, I have squeezed the files using a 
CP/M80 system.  SQ17.COM, USQ20.COM and CRCK.COM are CP/M-80 programs to 
squeeze, unsqueeze and perform hash checksums on the other files on this disk.
Type CRCK *.* and see if what you have agrees with the values listed below. 
This should assure you that you have a good copy of the disk. 


The VIEW word expects certain source blocks to be on drive A: and certain
source files to be on drive B:.  If you have a hard disk system, you can 
follow the directions in README.PC to recompile your system with all of the 
source blocks on your hard disk and the VIEW file numbers will be set up 
correctly. 

  Here are the files on the disk:
